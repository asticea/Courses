CaaS WP is using a flat structure file system. You use numbers in front of the sections and modules to order them to your liking. The numbers are only used for ordering the table of content and they will not show in the course TOC. 
### Creating Sections
Sections are used to group the modules in blocks. To add a section:

- Create an empty file with no extention 
- Start the name of the file with a two digit nummber. Eg. 01
- Commit the empty file into your course directory
