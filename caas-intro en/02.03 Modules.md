The content of your course is split into modules under sections. You cannot create a module without a parent section or an empty section. 
You can use MarkDown, HTML, or a mixture of those file types to format your content. If you use MD, you can preview the changes to your module directly in GitHub before you commit it.

### Creating a Module: 
- Create a file with MD extension 
- Start a file with a four-digit float to assign it to a section. For example, if your module needs to be the third one from the second section, use 02.03.
- Commit the changes after you created the module content.
